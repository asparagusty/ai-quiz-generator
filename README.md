üéØ Problem Understanding

Create an AI-powered quiz application that:

Allows users to select from various topics

Uses AI to generate 5 multiple-choice questions per topic

Provides an interactive quiz experience with navigation

Generates custom AI feedback based on user performance

**Assumptions Made**

Users have stable internet connection for AI API calls

Fallback questions provided if AI service is unavailable

Mobile-responsive design for cross-device compatibility

JSON parsing from AI responses requires error handling

**ü§ñ AI Prompts & Iterations**

Initial Prompt (V1)


"Generate 5 multiple choice questions about React"

Issues: Inconsistent format, no JSON structure, mixed response types

**Refined Prompt (V2)**


"Generate exactly 5 multiple-choice questions about ${topic}. 

Each question should have 4 options and one correct answer.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this format:
{
  'questions': [
    {
      'question': 'Question text?',
      'options': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'],
      'answer': 'Correct Answer'
    }
  ]
}"

Final Prompt 
text
"Create 3 multiple choice quiz questions about ${topic}. 
Each question should have 4 options and indicate the correct answer.
Format: 

Q1. Question? 
A) Option1 B) Option2 C) Option3 D) Option4 
Answer: A

Q2. Next question? 
A) Option1 B) Option2 C) Option3 D) Option4 
Answer: B"
Challenges & Solutions
JSON Parsing Issues: Added robust error handling with fallback questions

API Rate Limits: Implemented loading states and graceful degradation

Response Consistency: Used strict formatting requirements in prompts

üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Code Structure
File Structure
text
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.jsx                 # Main application component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.jsx               # Application entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css              # Global styles with Tailwind
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/            # (Potential expansion)
State Management
React Hooks: useState for local component state

Context: Not implemented (kept simple for this scope)

State Flow:

screen: Manages current view (topic ‚Üí loading ‚Üí quiz ‚Üí result)

questions: Stores AI-generated quiz questions

currentQ: Tracks current question index

score: Accumulates user score

AI Service Integration
javascript
// Hugging Face Inference API

const hf = new HfInference(import.meta.env.VITE_HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY);

const response = await hf.textGeneration({
  model: "microsoft/DialoGPT-medium",
  inputs: prompt,
  parameters: { max_new_tokens: 500, temperature: 0.7 }
});
